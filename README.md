# DarkBlocksX

Procedurally generated Voxel Game

The X is for experimental.
This is planned to be a community-driven Miny Crafty like game made with Unreal Engine 4.
There isn't much yet, because I'm still learning and the Unreal Engine's C++ documentation is awefull.

*Current Subject:* Collision detection for blocks in the HierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent(great naming btw).
